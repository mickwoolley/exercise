exercise
========

This was been used purely as a simple introduction to acquire some knowledge about how to produce an android app. 

The exercise includes the following:

- master list and detail selection
- retrieve information from a web service using async task and parse using gson (json) parser
- display detail in tabs in fragments
- include image reading off the UI thread using a (randomly selected) open source package

I started with Eclipse, but switched over to Android Studio, which also has really good integration with github.

This is not bug-free code, it's just a quick coding exercise, about four evenings from a cold start on Android. 
Looking forward to finding more opportunities to write an app now.
